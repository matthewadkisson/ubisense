# ubisense exercise

I used this example as an opportunity to try out some new things. I used the Vuetify component library which is something I leverage quite often in my day job. Vuetify has it's own directive/css sytax add responsiveness. Because I have used those for a couple of years I was a little rusty on using flexboxes. I decided to use this as an opportunity to use them in the cards. 

I have also historically used moment.js, but since it is no longer being actively maintained I used this as an opportunity to use Luxon for the first time. I found it quite easy to use and I will probably pick it up for my daily driver

I went ahead and add the router though this app only has one view. It's a pretty easy leap to see those cards being clicked/touched to go to a more detailed page so I thought it was worth setting it up for that possibility.


The fact that each of the workstations were matching to one engine tripped me up for a bit. It makes logical sense that multiple lines could make the same product, but my eye's were going cross eye'd looking at those id's trying to figure out if they were all the same :)
